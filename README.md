PodcastSync
================================================

A podcast Feed to Dropbox folder synchronization service

The idea is to be able to subscribe to podcasts and have episodes automatically
end up in your Dropbox. This is convenient to me because then my podcasts are
available on any of my devices - and I can favorite them on my mobile phone to
have them available offline as well.

So far this is just a proof of concept where the service authenticates against
the Dropbox API and then allows the user to download a single podcast episode.
